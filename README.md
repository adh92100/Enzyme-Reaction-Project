This code uses a dataset from https://zenodo.org/record/7530180 named ‘Biocatalysed_reaction_dataset.zip’ in the folder ‘training_dataset’. This set is split into ‘train’, ‘val’ and ‘test’ folders. This code combines each file into one large file just by changing the folder names. This code also makes smaller files to train the data the model on smaller dataset.
